Kohn-Sham equations:

.. math::

   \left[-\frac{1}{2}\nabla^2 + v_\mathrm{{\scriptscriptstyle S}}(\mathbf{r};
   \underline{\mathbf{R}})\right] \phi_j(\mathbf{r};
   \underline{\mathbf{R}}) = \epsilon_j \phi_j(\mathbf{r};
   \underline{\mathbf{R}})

Inline math:

Since Pythagoras, we know that :math:`a^2 + b^2 = c^2`.
