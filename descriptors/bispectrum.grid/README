This example shows how to generate the SNAP bispectrum on a grid.

Usage:

python3 ./grid.py > bgrid.out

Requirements:

Python3
LAMMPS, with compute sna/grid, from here:
https://github.com/athomps/lammps/tree/compute-grid

Before running, you will need to do the following:

1. Compile the LAMMPS shared library with the SNAP package installed
2. Make the shared library visible e.g.

ln -s $LAMMPS/src/liblammps.so .

The files that are produces are as follows:

bgrid.out: Screen output from LAMMPS and bgrid.py
log.lammps: LAMMPS log file
b.dump: per-atom bispectrum components
bgrid.dat: grid bispectrum components as LAMMPS array
bgrid_np.dat: grid bispectrum components as Numpy array

You can compare these to the corresponding files
with names containing a timestamp e.g. b_25Oct2019.dump
