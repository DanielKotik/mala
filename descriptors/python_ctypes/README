This folder contains examples of Python interfaces to C, C++, and F90 functions.
In all cases, the Python ctypes module is used and the functions are
compiled as shared library objects.

https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html

To compile the shared libraries, do:

gcc -shared -fPIC -o test_libraryc.so test_library.c
g++ -shared -fPIC -o test_librarycpp.so test_library.cpp
gfortran -shared -fPIC -o test_libraryf90.so test_library.f90

To test the fuctions from Python, do:

python test_library.py

Here is a summary of the functions:

1. hello_world() works for C, C++, and F90
2. create_matrix() works for C and C++
3. create_vector() works for F90
4. I could not figure out how to make create_matrix() work for F90.
